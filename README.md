# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Launches the application in development mode.
Open http://localhost:3000 to see it in your browser.

The page will reload automatically when you change the code.
You can also see lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Starts the test launcher in interactive monitoring mode.
For more information, see the section on running tests.[running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests)

### `npm run build`

Compile the application for production in the build folder.
It generates a bundle of React optimized for production and makes it the most efficient possible.

The bundle is minified, and filenames include hashes.
Your application is ready for deployment!

See the Deployment section for details.

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

Note: this operation is irreversible. Once eject is executed, it is impossible to go back!

If the default configuration choices are not suitable for you, you can choose to run eject at any time. This command copies all configuration files (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc.) directly into your project so you can edit them. All commands, except eject, will continue to work, but they will now point to copied scripts, allowing you to customize them freely.

There is no need to use eject. The default configuration is suitable for small or medium-sized deployments, but if you need more control, this option is available.
